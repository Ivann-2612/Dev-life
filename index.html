		     <img class="img1" src="img/img-54.jpg" align="left" /><p>Wake up, go to work, stare at a screen, come back home, sleep. This is the daily routine of a typical developer. And it’s a fact that developers spent majority of their time with computers. Away from general public or the human presence. Few days back Stack Overflow released their developer survey for 2018. And guess what, more than 60% of participants spend 9 hours or more per day with a computer.
            I am a developer who belongs to that 60%.I was glued to computers and was spending lots of time alone.
            Humans are social creatures and they need human presence, interactions to live a normal life. When you get away from society, you become blind and blunt. You lose the ability to dream, imagine and to think creatively.
            On the other hand software development is stressful and challenging. Tight deadlines are one side of the story. Then you have to keep up with market trends, customer demands and many unforeseen complications. We as programmers orchestrate code lines to execute and get an output. One could think of this an art. To master 
            an art one must have a relaxed mind. So a stressed mind is not good for developers.
            After understanding these two facts, I wanted to change. Change the way I balance my work and life. I wanted find ways to interact, relax and understand the world. I tried different solutions and here I present the top three.</p>

		     <h2>Travel & Explore</h2>
		     <img class="img1" src="img/img-55.jpg" align="right" /><p>Travelling is fun and relaxing, isn’t it? Especially when you go to a new country a new place. You meet new people, make friends and explore cultures. You see how people live, how they spend daily life. Going through attractions, you add more memories to your life. Those are things that one could recall and be happy about. Life is not there to stare at a screen and spend the day inside four walls. Cross borders and see what’s going around the 
No, I am not saying only about travelling around the world. Why not have a walk to the town near to you. Take a ride in a train or a bus and observe people. Meet your friends and chat over a beer. Talk face to face rather than over social media. Sometimes you don’t have to cross boarders to explore new things. Wonders could wait for you even when you walk down a street.
So, travel & explore, spend few hours a week to see how world outside function. Get away from digital world and interact with your surrounding.</p><blockquote>You can't use up creativity. </br>The more you code, the more you know.
